The U-Net and a geometric-based approach are used together in this framework to get structured data from forms. The file main.py in the root directory is the starting point for the geometric-based approach. The U-Net code is placed under the folder UNET, so the framework is actually for the geometric-based approach. This approach is not a learned model, and therefore no validation and testing steps are included. Instead, the training step acts as a test step. The geographic-based approach uses the trained model of the U-Net and, on the output, applies geometry computation to the other segments.
This framework is taken from the SPADE paper. So, in this framework, our model is implemented. Therefore, the format of the input data is the same as SPADE, but the methods are completely different.
